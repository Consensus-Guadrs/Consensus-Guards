# About us
<br>We are professional validators of blockchain networks. We specialize in Cosmos Network ecosystem, but also have the ability to validate and provide validation consulting support on any networks.
# Networks
<br>[Mainnets we validate](https://cguards.pro/mainnets)

# Our features
<br>We are certified graduates of the School of Validators, which allows us to provide any network in a professional and competent manner. 
<br>We ensure the smooth operation of our nodes, which are carefully selected and installed to meet the individual needs of the networks, geographically ensuring maximum decentralization and reliability of the networks.
<br>From the other side we are deeply embedded and involved in the life and growth of every ecosystem and network we validate.
